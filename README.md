Our AI-Powered Learning Tool with Google Cloud Technologies is an ASL learning website. 
The website initially welcomes the user by providing different options to the user to choose from. One of the features provided is a timed quiz, that will allow the user to understand their level at ASL. 
The quiz is developed by recognizing, ASL letter images that will be uploaded by the user. By using google cloud solutions like Vertex AI, the website is machine trained to recognize the uploaded image.
The website will communicate with the AI using an API. If the data entered matches the AI prediction, the answer will be marked as correct. After answering few questions, according to the number of correct signed letters, the user will be assigned a designated path to follow to learn ASL. 
The schedule which is auto-generated is adjustable to the user. 
The website will also provide text to ASL conversion using database retrieval. Finally a live bot will also be implemented for the students who use the application, to interactively learn ASL.
